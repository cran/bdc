#' Harmonizing taxon names against local stored taxonomic databases
#'
# Harmonization of scientific names from several taxonomic groups against

#' @family taxonomy
#' @param sci_name character string. Containing scientific names to be queried.

#' The taxonomic harmonization is based upon one taxonomic authority database.
#' The lastest version of each database is used to perform queries, but
#' note that only older versions are available for some taxonomic databases. The
#' database version is shown in parenthesis. Note that some databases are
#' momentary unavailable in taxadb.

#' The bdc_query_names_taxadb processes as this:
#'
#' **Creation of a local taxonomic database**
#'
#' This is a one-time setup used to download, extract, and import the taxonomic
#' databases specified in the argument "db". The downloading process may take a
#' few minutes depending on your connection and database size. By default, the
#' "gbif" database following a Darwin Core schema is installed. (see
#' ?taxadb::td_create for details).
#'
#' **Taxonomic harmonization**
#'
#' The taxonomic harmonization is divided into two distinct phases according to
#' the matching type to be undertaken.
#'
#' **Exact matching**
#'
#' Firstly, the algorithm attempts to find an exact matching
#' for each original scientific name supplied using the function "filter_name"
#' from taxadb package. If an exact matching cannot be found, names are returned
#' as Not Available (NA). Also, it is possible that a scientific name match
#' multiple accepted names. In such cases, the "bdc_clean_duplicates" function
#' is used to flag and remove names with multiple accepted names.
#'
#' Information on higher taxa (e.g., kingdom or phylum) can be used to
#' disambiguate names linked to multiple accepted names. For example, the genus
#' "Casearia" is present in both Animalia and Plantae kingdoms. When handling
#' names of Plantae, it would be helpful to get rid of names belonging to the
#' Animalia to avoid flagging "Caseria" as having multiple accepted names.
#' Following Norman et al. (2020), such cases are left to be fixed by the user.
#' If "export_accepted" = TRUE a database containing a list of all records with
#' names linked to multiple accepted names is saved in the "Output" folder.
#'
#' **Fuzzy matching**
#'
#' Fuzzy matching will be applied when "suggest_names" is TRUE and only for
#' names not resolved by an exact match. In such cases, a fuzzy matching
#' algorithm processes name-matching queries to find a potential matching
#' candidate from the specified taxonomic database. Fuzzy matching identifies
#' probable names (here identified as suggested names) for original names via a
#' measure of orthographic similarity (i.e., distance). Orthographic distance is
#' calculated by optimal string alignment (restricted Damerau-Levenshtein
#' distance) that counts the number of deletions, insertions, substitutions, and
#' adjacent characters' transpositions. It ranges from 0 to 1, being 1 an
#' indicative of a perfect match. A threshold distance, i.e. the lower value of
#' match acceptable, can be informed by user (in the "suggest_distance"
#' argument). If the distance of a candidate name is equal or higher than the
#' distance informed by user, the candidate name is returned as suggested name.
#' Otherwise, names are returned as NA.
#'
#' To increase the probability of finding a potential match candidate and to
#' save time, two steps are taken before conducting fuzzy matching. First, if
#' supplied, information on higher taxon (e.g., kingdom, family) is used to
#' filter the taxonomic database. This step removes matching ambiguity by
#' avoiding matching names from unrelated taxonomic ranks (e.g., match a plant
#' species against a taxonomic database containing animal names) and decreases
#' the number of names in the taxonomic database used to calculate the matching
#' distance. Then, the taxonomic database is filtered according to a set of
#' firsts letters of all input names. This process reduces the number of names
#' in the taxonomic database to which each original name should be compared When
#' a same suggested name is returned for different input names, a warning is
#' returned asking users to check whether the suggested name is valid.
#'
#' **Report**
#'
#' The name harmonization processes' quality can be accessed in the column
#' "notes" placed in the table resulting from the name harmonization process.
#' The column "notes" contains assertions on the name harmonization process
#' based on Carvalho (2017). The notes can be grouped in two categories:
#' accepted names and those with a taxonomic issue or warning, needing further
#' inspections. Accepted names can be returned as "accepted" (valid accepted
#' name), "replaceSynonym" (a synonym replaced by an accepted name),
#' "wasMisspelled" (original name was misspelled), "wasMisspelled |
#' replaceSynonym" (misspelled synonym replaced by an accepted name), and
#' "synonym" (original names is a synonym without accepted names in the
#' database). Similarly, the following notes are used to flag taxonomic issues:
#' "notFound" (no matching name found), "multipleAccepted" (name with multiple
#' accepted names), "noAcceptedName" (no accepted name found), and ambiguous
#' synonyms such as "heterotypic synonym", "homotypic synonym", and "pro-parte
#' synonym". Ambiguous synonyms, names that have been published more than once
#' describing different species, have more than one accepted name and cannot be
#' resolved. Such cases are flagged and left to be determined by the user.

#' @return This function returns data.frame containing the results of the
#' taxonomic harmonization process. The database is returned in the same order
#' of sci_name.
